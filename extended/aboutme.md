# Hey! I'm axtlos üê¢
## Looks like you've managed to get to my website, or rather the part where I tell some information about myself  
  
I'm a german developer who specialises on tools for *nix system  
most of these tools are written with either rust or python, sometimes also bash.  
  
## OS of choice
I use linux as my daily os (arch as of now, btw), but I've used every "mainstream" os by now, windows, mac, linux as well as FreeBSD  
  
I've been using linux for about 7 years by now, I've used following distros:

- Arch linux and many arch deriviates
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- OpenSUSE
- NixOS
- gentoo

## Programming languages I know
As said above, I use rust and python the most, as those are my favourite languages

I have experience with other languages however:

- Traditional Languages:
    - Rust
    - Python
    - Java
    - Bash
    - C
    - C#
- Markdown Languages:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript

## Some Projects which I made that I like the most
I've been doing Software developing for a while now, most of my projects are lost by now, but there are still some on my github that I am proud of
These being:
  
- [overengineered hello world](https://github.com/axtloss/overengineered-hello-world) just because it's so random and useless
- [vAssistant](https://github.com/axtloss/vAssistant) something actually useful from me
- [ame](https://github.com/crystal-linux/ame) the rust rebuild of a package manager/aur helper/pacman wrapper for a distribution I am building with friends
- [amethyst](https://github.com/crystal-linux/amethyst) a package manager/aur helper/pacman wrapper for a distribution I am building with friends
- [antinotechsavvy](https://github.com/axtloss/antinotechsavvy) a program to encrypt and decrypt your files so that people that arent very tech savvy cant view your files

## Some stuff I'm affiliated with
[crystal linux](https://crystal-ux.com) an arch deriviate designed to work for both powerusers and linux newcomers.
